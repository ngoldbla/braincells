## üß† What is Brain Cells?

**Brain Cells** brings intelligent automation to the spreadsheet interface, fully locally. This starter kit combines the best open source and open weights projects into a unified platform:

- **ü§ó Hugging Face Sheets** - Open source spreadsheet interface for AI-powered data manipulation
- **üï∑Ô∏è Crawl4AI** - Advanced web scraping and data extraction
- **ü§ñ Ollama** - Local LLM runtime for complete privacy
- **üéØ Open Weights Models** - Run state-of-the-art models without cloud dependencies

Developed by **Dylan Goldblatt** at the **Kennesaw State University Office of Research**, Brain Cells transforms your research workstation into an intelligent data processing hub ‚Äì think of each cell in your spreadsheet as a "brain cell" capable of understanding and transforming data.

### üéØ Open Source Components

| Service  | What it does | Default URL |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Hugging Face Sheets** | Open source spreadsheet UI for prompting, cleaning & enriching data with any LLM | <http://localhost:3000> |
| **Ollama**    | Open source local model runner with open weights LLMs | <http://localhost:11434> (REST) |
| **Crawl4AI** | Open source web crawler/scraper optimized for LLM data pipelines | CLI in the `crawl4ai` container |

> üìù **Attribution:** Brain Cells is a bundle created from the open source [Hugging Face AI Sheets](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFace/ai-sheets) project, enhanced with intelligent automation features and customized for research use.

## ü¶â Quick Start for KSU Researchers

> **Prerequisites for Research Workstations**
> * Docker Desktop **v24+** (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
> * ~15 GB free disk space (for AI models)
> * KSU network access or VPN connection (for initial setup)
> * Optional: NVIDIA GPU for accelerated inference

```bash
# 1. Clone the Brain Cells repository
 git clone https://github.com/ngoldbla/braincells.git
 cd braincells

# 2. Copy env template and edit values
 cp .env.template .env
 $EDITOR .env   # or open with VS Code / Notepad / TextEdit

# 3. Fire it up ü¶â
 docker compose up -d

# 4. Open your browser
 open http://localhost:3000   # macOS
 start http://localhost:3000  # Windows PowerShell
```

First load may take several minutes while Docker pulls images **and** Ollama downloads the model you selected.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Research Environment Configuration (.env)

Configure your research environment by creating a `.env` file (step 2 above). The KSU Office of Research provides template configurations for common research scenarios.

```ini
# === KSU Research Configuration ===
# Contact ngoldbla@kennesaw.edu for institutional tokens

# === Mandatory ===
HF_TOKEN=           # Institutional or personal token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

# === Optional cloud providers ===
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
# or another Inference Endpoint:  MODEL_ENDPOINT_URL=https://....

# === Local model ===
# Pick ONE from the table below. Larger models need more RAM/VRAM.
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
```

### Model Selection Guide for Research Applications

| `OLLAMA_MODEL` value | VRAM / RAM needed | Research Use Cases |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `phi:2.7b`           | 4 GB              | Quick data annotation, basic text classification |
| `gemma:2b`           | 6 GB              | Literature review assistance, creative text generation |
| `mistral:7b`         | 8 GB              | Research paper summarization, data analysis |
| `gpt-oss:20b` (default) | 12‚Äì14 GB        | Advanced NLP tasks, comprehensive research assistance |
| `gpt-oss:120b`       | 30‚Äì40 GB          | State-of-the-art performance for complex research tasks |

If you don‚Äôt want any local model (e.g. you‚Äôll use OpenAI), set `DISABLE_OLLAMA=true`.

### Cloud only?

Just leave `OLLAMA_MODEL` blank **and** supply one of:

* `HF_TOKEN` ‚Äì runs via Hugging Face Inference Endpoints (pay-as-you-go)
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì uses OpenAI Chat Completions
* `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` ‚Äì uses Claude models

Brain Cells automatically picks the first available backend for intelligent processing.

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform-Specific Guidelines for Research Workstations

### Windows 11/10

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and enable **WSL 2 backend**.
2. Run the commands in *PowerShell*.
3. To open the app after boot: `docker compose start`.

### macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)

* Docker Desktop handles multi-arch images ‚Äì the stack ships `linux/arm64` & `linux/amd64`.
* Use `brew install ollama` if you ever want to run Ollama outside Docker.

### Linux

* Any recent distro with Docker Engine works.
* Add your user to `docker` group to avoid `sudo` each time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Research Workflow Integration

### Hugging Face Sheets for Intelligent Data Analysis

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Click **‚öô Settings ‚Üí Keys** to paste additional API keys any time.
3. Create or upload a CSV, then type a prompt in a new column, hit **‚ñ∂ Run**.

### Crawl4AI for Web Data Collection

Open a shell in the container:

```bash
docker compose exec crawl4ai bash
# example crawl
crwl https://docs.python.org --deep-crawl bfs --max-pages 20 --output markdown
```

Results appear under `./data` inside the container (mount volumes if you need persistence).

### Direct Model API Access for Custom Research Applications

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model":"gpt-oss:20b","prompt":"Hello"}' | jq -r .response
```

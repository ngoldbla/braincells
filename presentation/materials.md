## What Can Brain Cells Actually Do?

Every startup needs to move fast and make data-driven decisions. Brain Cells transforms how startups conduct research - from initial idea validation to scaling operations. Here are the research capabilities that matter most to early-stage companies building their competitive advantage.

---

### Market Research & Competitive Analysis
	"Analyze {{competitor_website}} and extract their value proposition"
	"Generate TAM/SAM/SOM calculations from {{industry_report}}"
	"Create investor pitch points based on {{market_gap}}"
	"Identify underserved segments in {{customer_feedback}}"

Accelerate your market research from weeks to hours. Import competitor data, industry reports, or customer feedback, then use AI to extract insights and identify opportunities. For example, analyze 100 competitor websites to find positioning gaps, or process industry reports to calculate your total addressable market with supporting evidence.

---

### Investor & Funding Intelligence
	"Extract investment thesis from {{vc_portfolio_page}}"
	"Identify check size and stage focus of {{investor_name}}"
	"Find warm intro paths to {{target_investor}}"
	"Parse {{investor_interview}} for funding criteria"

Startups need actionable investor intelligence fast. Import VC websites, portfolio data, or interview transcripts, then extract exactly what you need to know: investment thesis, check sizes, portfolio patterns, and decision criteria. Enable "Search the web" to get the latest funding announcements and investor movements. Turn fundraising from spray-and-pray to targeted outreach.

---

### Customer Discovery & Problem Validation
	"Categorize {{user_interview}} by pain point severity"
	"Score {{survey_response}} for product-market fit signals"
	"Extract jobs-to-be-done from {{customer_feedback}}"
	"Identify early adopter characteristics in {{user_data}}"

Validate your startup hypotheses with data, not assumptions. Import user interviews, surveys, or support tickets, then use AI to identify patterns that predict product-market fit. The validation feature is crucial - manually correct a few categorizations to teach the model your specific ICP criteria, then scale that learning across hundreds of interviews.

---

### Lead Generation & Enrichment
	"Find decision maker titles at {{target_company}}"
	"Enrich {{company_name}} with employee count and funding data"
	"Identify tech stack from {{company_website}}"

	Startup Success Stories
## How Founders Are Accelerating Research

From pre-seed to Series A, startups are using Brain Cells to validate faster, research deeper, and scale smarter. Here are real research workflows that have helped startups find product-market fit, close funding rounds, and outmaneuver competitors.

---

### Pre-Seed: Problem Discovery Research
	"Extract specific problems from {{interview_transcript}}"
	"Rate problem severity on scale of 1-10 based on {{description}}"
	"Identify willingness to pay signals in {{customer_feedback}}"


A pre-seed founder interviewed 100 potential customers and used Brain Cells to systematically extract and rank problems. They identified three critical pain points that 80% of interviewees shared, validated willingness to pay above $200/month, and discovered an underserved enterprise segment. This research became the foundation of their successful pre-seed raise.

---

### Seed: Competitive Intelligence Gathering
	"Analyze {{competitor}} pricing model and identify gaps"
	"Extract features from {{product_page}} and categorize by importance"
	"Compare our positioning vs {{competitor_messaging}}"

A seed-stage B2B SaaS analyzed 50 competitors using Brain Cells. They scraped competitor websites, imported the data, and used AI to extract pricing models, feature sets, and positioning. This revealed a $40-80/month gap in the market with specific features no one offered. They launched into this gap and hit $50K MRR in 6 months.

---

### Series A: Market Expansion Research
	"Identify new use cases in {{customer_success_story}}"
	"Score {{industry_vertical}} for expansion potential"
	"Generate ICP variations based on {{existing_customer_profile}}"

A Series A startup used Brain Cells to analyze 500 customer success stories and identify expansion opportunities. They discovered three new verticals using their product in unexpected ways, validated TAM expansion from $100M to $500M, and generated targeted messaging for each new segment. This research backed their $15M Series A.

---

### AI Startups: Training Data Generation
	"Generate examples of {{use_case}} for model training"
	"Create edge cases for {{product_feature}} testing"
	"Synthesize customer queries in {{industry_domain}}"
	"Generate labeled data for {{classification_task}}"

AI startups use Brain Cells to bootstrap training data. One YC company generated 10,000 labeled examples for their classifier, added edge cases their model was failing on, and created synthetic customer queries for testing. They improved model accuracy from 76% to 94% and saved $50K in data labeling costs. The local processing meant their proprietary approach stayed confidential.

---
	Getting Started
## Your First Brain Cells Workflow

Brain Cells gives you two ways to start: import existing data or generate a dataset from scratch. Think of the "from scratch" option as an auto-dataset or prompt-to-dataset feature - you describe what you want, and Brain Cells creates the entire dataset structure and content for you.

---

### Step 1: Choose Your Starting Point
	**Generate from scratch:** "Cities of the world with landmarks in Ghibli style"
	**Import your data:** Upload XLS, TSV, CSV, or Parquet (up to 1,000 rows)
	**Import from Hub:** Load any Hugging Face dataset directly

For example, if you type "cities of the world, alongside countries they belong to and a landmark image for each, generated in Ghibli style", Brain Cells will automatically generate a dataset with three columns and five sample rows. You can then expand to up to 1,000 rows or modify the structure. Important: imported cells are manually editable but can't be modified by AI prompts, while AI-generated cells can be regenerated and refined.

---

### Step 2: Define Your Research Questions
	Click "+" to add AI-powered research columns
	"What problem does {{customer}} describe in {{interview}}?"
	"Rate {{feedback}} on a product-market fit scale of 1-10"
	"Extract the main value prop from {{competitor_website}}"

Each column becomes a research question applied across all your data. Reference other columns with double curly braces. For example, if you have "company_description" and "target_market" columns, create a new column: "Generate a positioning statement for {{company_description}} targeting {{target_market}}". Chain multiple research questions to build sophisticated analysis pipelines.

---

### Step 3: Configure and Run
	Select your AI model and provider for different performance
	Toggle "Search the web" for up-to-date information
	Click "Run" to generate results for all rows

Watch as Brain Cells populates your new column. Some providers have faster inference and different context lengths - test different combinations for your specific task. You can stop, adjust, and re-run at any time. Pro tip: start with 5-10 rows to test your prompt, then expand once you're happy with the results.

---

### Step 4: Iterate and Refine with Feedback
	**Edit cells:** Click any cell to provide examples of preferred output
	**Like results:** Use thumbs-up to mark good examples
	**Regenerate:** Apply your feedback to improve all cells
	**Drag down:** Generate more rows instantly from the last cell

The iterative workflow is key. Under the hood, your manually edited and liked cells become few-shot examples for generating cells when you regenerate or add more. This is like fine-tuning prompts very efficiently by looking at your data in real-time! You can also drag down from the last cell to generate additional rows immediately - no regeneration needed.

---
	Advanced Capabilities
## Pushing the Boundaries

Successful startups don't just collect data - they build research systems that continuously generate insights. Brain Cells enables advanced research workflows that would typically require a team of analysts or expensive consulting engagements. The key: your validated research criteria become reusable templates for ongoing intelligence gathering.

---

### Multi-Stage Research Pipelines
	Column 1: "Extract company name and description from {{website}}"
	Column 2: "Identify industry and business model of {{company}}"
	Column 3: "Score {{company}} as potential customer (1-10) based on ICP"
	Column 4: "Generate personalized outreach for score >7"

Build intelligent research pipelines that qualify and prioritize opportunities. For example, import a list of companies, then create a chain: extract company info → identify if they match your ICP → score opportunity → generate personalized outreach only for high-scores. This systematic approach helped one startup increase their cold email response rate from 2% to 18%.

---

### Dynamic Research Strategies
	"If {{company_size}} > 1000, research enterprise pain points
	If {{funding_stage}} = 'Series B+', analyze scaling challenges
	If {{industry}} = 'FinTech', check regulatory compliance needs"

Adapt your research based on the data you discover. Different segments need different research approaches - enterprise customers have different pain points than SMBs, funded startups have different budgets than bootstrapped ones. Brain Cells applies the right research lens to each row, giving you nuanced insights that generic analysis would miss.

---

### Research Model Selection Strategy
	**Fast Iteration:** Llama 3.2 for quick hypothesis testing
	**Deep Analysis:** GPT-OSS for complex reasoning tasks
	**Bulk Processing:** Phi for processing thousands of rows
	**Specialized Research:** Domain models for industry-specific analysis

Different research tasks need different models. Use fast models to quickly test research approaches on samples, then switch to more powerful models for final analysis. One founder tested 10 different research questions using Phi, identified the 3 most insightful ones, then ran GPT-OSS on their full dataset for those specific questions - reducing costs by 80% while improving insight quality.

---

	Research Best Practices
## Maximizing Your Intelligence ROI

Years of startup research experience have taught us what works. Here are battle-tested approaches to get actionable insights faster and avoid common research pitfalls that waste precious runway.

---

### Start Small, Validate, Then Scale
	**Test with 5-10 rows first**

Don't process 1000 customer interviews before validating your approach. Start with a sample, refine your prompts, validate the insights are actionable, then scale. This prevents wasting time and computational resources on flawed research questions.

#### Research Validation Checklist
	✓ Do the insights lead to specific actions?
	✓ Can you make decisions based on this data?
	✓ Would you pay for these insights?
	✓ Do patterns emerge from the sample?

If yes to all, scale to your full dataset. If no, refine your approach. One founder saved 40 hours by testing their research approach on 10 interviews before processing 500.

---

### Research Velocity Optimization
	**Choose the right model for each research phase**

#### Discovery Phase (Speed > Precision)
	Use Phi or Llama 3.2 for rapid iteration
	Test 10+ research questions quickly
	Identify promising research directions

#### Validation Phase (Balance)
	Use Mistral for deeper analysis
	Process full sample sets
	Refine research criteria

#### Production Phase (Precision > Speed)
	Use GPT-OSS for final insights
	Process complete datasets
	Generate investor-ready analysis
